# Code

Import your code here or use the PowerShell script `\utils\InstallGitRepo.ps1` instead.

You need to populate this directory with the following:

- requirements.txt
  - This should be the python packages required for your code
- (optionally) any custom modules / resource files
  - They will be included in the package for use by the python process
